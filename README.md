# Pathogen Detection Project 

**Contributors**: Avril Lim, A Janhavi, Amelia Regina Sutikna 

## Project Context 
Using metagenomics data to detect pathogens with precision and accuracy is important for diagnosis and treatment of severe infection. This project addresses the multi-class supervised classification task of detecting pathogens from a set of 6-mers. Three machine learning algorithms were tested - eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), light gradient boosting (LightGBM) and support vector machines (SVM).
